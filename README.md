# Geometric-Volume-Calculator---C-Project
This C++ project calculates the volume of basic geometric shapes: a sphere, a cylinder, and a cuboid. The program prompts the user to choose a shape, inputs the required dimensions, and computes the volume using mathematical formulas. It includes options for repeated calculations, error handling for invalid choices, and user-friendly prompts. This code is modular, using functions to improve readability and maintainability.
